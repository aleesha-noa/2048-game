# 2048-game

Hello! I am currently using this repo to expand my knowledge of game developement by experimenting with the game mechanics of the classic '2048' game, using Pygame and Python. I am continuing to make updates and changes as I go, but wanted to publish what's here so far! 

I created the base of this using an online tutorial and am currently exploring ways to customize the game as this is my first project using Pygame.
