# 2048-game

I am currently using this repository to expand my knowledge of game development by experimenting with the mechanics of the classic *2048* game. This is an active project, and new changes and updates are being committed frequently.

### Tech Used
- Python
- Pygame

## Notes

This is my first time developing a project using Pygame. Some updates and changes I'm currently working on are:

- Adding an end-of-game message  
- Increasing tile movement speed  
- Creating smoother transitions when tiles are combined
